		<div>The intestines are important organs involved in digestion. They are responsible for breaking down food so that the body can used it for energy.

The small intestine contains very tiny finger-like structures called Villi, that help you to absorb nutrients from the food you eat. If the villi are damaged, you won’t be able to absorb the nutrients needed to survive. Problems with the small intestine can include Celiac and Crohns disease, infections, and intestinal ulcers.</div>
		<div>
</div>
		<div>Did you know the body’s largest organ is in fact the Skin? The Skin is very important for protection of our bones and internal organs. The skin allows us to regulate our body temperature and allows us the sense of touch!

The skin is vulnerable to damage since it is so exposed to the world around us! The skin is pretty good at repairing small wounds itself. More severe wounds might be caused by open fractures that break the skin, skin cancer, or burns.</div>
		<div>Did you know the average person breathes in around 11 000 litres of air every day! The lungs transport oxygen from the air we breathe in into the bloodstream, and removes carbon dioxide, which is released into the air when we breathe out.

The air sacs in the lungs can be damaged by injuries, viruses, or lung disease. Certain diseases of the lungs can cause inefficient gas exchange, which can make it difficult to breath. Common lung tissue diseases include Pulmonary Fibrosis and Lung Cancer.</div>
		<div>Did you know there are 206 bones in the Human Body? Bones provide the main structure for our bodies and are made from connective tissue which is reinforced with calcium and specialised bone cells.

The most common injuries to our bones are breaks and fractures, usually caused by sports activities or accidents. Other diseases include Paget’s and Osteoporosis, whereby the bone tissue can waste away and become weak.</div>
		<div>Most of our Skeletal Muscles are attached to our bones. They can contract and relax allowing us to move our limbs. When we exercise, we work our muscles which allows them to become bigger and stronger.

Severe musculoskeletal injuries can result in Volumetric Muscle Loss (VML), usually occurring after trauma injuries. In some cases, these injuries can lead to complete loss of function.</div>
		<div>The heart is made of a special type of muscle known as Cardiac Muscle. The muscles of the heart contract and relax to continuously pump blood around the body. Unlike the skeletal muscles, Cardiac muscle is involuntary, meaning a person cannot consciously control its’ function.

Cardiovascular diseases are very serious but common diseases of the heart and blood vessels. Some forms of cardiovascular disease are caused by defects in the heart valves or holes in the heart chambers, that develop in the womb.</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>Nice work! You have regenerated heart tissue</div>
		<div>Button</div>
		<div>The heart itself has quite limited ability to repair itself, therefore transplantation is often the only solution. Scientists are investigating how cardiac patches made from biomaterials may be able to repair defects in the heart, and how mechanical or 3D printed biomaterial heart valves may be able to replace leaky heart valves.</div>
		<div>Diseases of the small intestine are common. Transplantation may be the only option in patients with severe damage or disease. Scientists in the field of intestinal tissue engineering are investigating new regenerative therapies. Some research groups are looking at how Villi-like structures may be reconstructed from collagen hydrogel biomaterial scaffolds using 3D bio-fabrication techniques.</div>
		<div>Nice work! You have regenerated intestine tissue</div>
		<div>Nice work! You have regenerated lung tissue</div>
		<div>Currently there are no effective treatments for most advanced lung diseases. Lung transplantation is often the only option. Scientists are using stem cells grown in 3D biomaterial scaffolds to investigate and better understand some of these diseases. Some are even looking at ways to grow stem cells on decellularized lung tissue from other humans and animals.</div>
		<div>Because our bones are made up of active, living cells which constantly remodel the tissue, bones can often heal small injuries themselves. More severe injuries may require artificial joints and bone cements – both of which are biomaterials used for bone repair! Scientists are also investigating ways to graft stem-cell derived bone cells into the injury site, to encourage the bone to remodel and repair itself.</div>
		<div>Nice work! You have regenerated bone tissue</div>
		<div>Nice work! You have regenerated skeletal muscle</div>
		<div>Current treatments for VML involve grafting muscle tissue from other parts of the body. However, the damaged muscle fibers do not usually make a full recovery. Scientists are investigating how muscle cells derived from the patient’s own stem cells may be grown on elastic biomaterials with fibrous structures, which may then be transplanted into patients with VML.</div>
		<div>Nice work! You have regenerated skin tissue</div>
		<div>When the skin is severely damaged, it may try to heal itself by forming scar tissue, which often appears discoloured and lacks sweat glands or hair. Scientists are investigating ways to engineer skin resembling healthy skin, often by combining skin stem cells with natural biomaterials such as collagen or elastin, both of which are naturally found in the skin tissue.</div>
